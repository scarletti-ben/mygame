    Have the tooltip class handle 'get_tooltip_lines' by having specified functions for each descriptor type
        Implement default descriptor and error tooltips "object has an unrecognised descriptor"

    * Give update methods to sprites and entities
        * Have a boolean that checks if the sprite/entity has ever been updated
        * Raise error if the entity should be updating every frame

# Create a discarding screen, as in a select card to discard screen with a dimmed version of the background
    # Ensure there is a hide / unhide button for the display beneath
    ~ Extend the functionality to card reward screen
* Possibly achieved with a layer system for draw queue where the second layer covers the entire game
    * and then top layer objects are drawn on top
